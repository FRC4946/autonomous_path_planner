# autonomous_path_planner

GUI for autonomous path planning. To be run on the driver station.

This project requires the Apache Commons Net library and was built for Java 1.8.

Main project source exists in the `ca._4946.mreynolds` package. The code in the default and `paths` packages are leftover debugging tools and will be removed in future.

Note that due to scaling issues in Java 1.8, this project MUST be built and run using Java 1.8 rather than 1.9. This is consistent with the requirements for FRC and WPILibJ in 2018.
