# autonomous_path_planner

GUI for autonomous path planning in the 2018 FRC season. Theoretically adaptable to future years. To be run on the driver station laptop.

This project requires the Apache Commons Net library and was built for Java 1.8.

Note that due to Windows 10 display scaling issues in Java 1.8, this project MUST be built and run using Java 1.8 rather than 1.9. This is consistent with the requirements for FRC and WPILibJ in 2018.
